//! Yamux multiplexing protocol.
//!
//! The Yamux protocol is a multiplexing protocol. As such, it allows dividing a single stream of
//! data, typically a TCP socket, into multiple individual parallel substreams. The data sent and
//! received over that single stream is divided into frames which, with the exception of `ping`
//! and `goaway` frames, belong to a specific substream. In other words, the data transmitted
//! over the substreams is interleaved.
//!
//! Specification available at <https://github.com/hashicorp/yamux/blob/master/spec.md>
//!
//! # Usage
//!
//! The [`Yamux`] object holds the state of all yamux-specific information, and the list of
//! all currently-open substreams.
//!
//! The generic parameter of [`Yamux`] is an opaque "user data" associated to each substream.
//!
