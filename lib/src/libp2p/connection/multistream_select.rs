//! Multistream-select is a protocol whose purpose is to negotiate protocols.
//!
//! # Context
//!
//! The multistream-select protocol makes it possible for two parties to negotiate a protocol.
//!
//! When using TCP connections, it is used immediately after a connection opens in order to
//! negotiate which encryption protocol to use, then after the encryption protocol handshake to
//! negotiate which multiplexing protocol to use.
//!
//! It is also used every time a substream opens in order to negotiate which protocol to use for
//! this substream in particular.
//!
//! Once a protocol has been negotiated, the connection or substream immediately starts speaking
//! this protocol.
//!
//! The multistream-select protocol is asymmetric: one side needs to be the dialer and the other
//! side the listener. In the context of a TCP connection, the dialer and listener correspond to
//! the dialer and listener of the connection. In the context of a substream, the dialer is the
//! side that initiated the opening of the substream.
//!
//! # About protocol names
//!
//! Due to flaws in the wire protocol design, a protocol named `na` causes an ambiguity in
//! the exchange. Because protocol names are normally decided ahead of time, this situation is
//! expected to never arise, except in the presence of a malicious remote. The decision has been
//! taken that such protocol will always fail to negotiate, but will also not produce any error
//! or panic.
//!
//! Please don't intentionally name a protocol `na`.
//!
//! # Usage
//!
//! To be written.
//!
//! # See also
//!
//! - [Official repository](https://github.com/multiformats/multistream-select)
