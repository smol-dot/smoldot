//! # About resources allocation and back-pressure
//!
//! In order to avoid DoS attacks, it is important, in networking code, to make sure that the
//! amount of memory allocated directly or indirectly by a connection stays bounded.
//!
//! The situations in the [`SingleStream`] that lead to an increase in memory consumption are:
//!
//! 1- On incoming or outgoing substreams.
//! 2- When sending a request or receiving a response in a request-response protocol.
//! 3- When sending a notification.
//! 4- When receiving a request and sending back a response.
//! 5- When receiving a notification.
//! // TODO: 6- on Yamux ping frames
//!
//! In order to solve 1-, there exists a maximum number of simultaneous substreams allowed by the
//! protocol, thereby guaranteeing that the memory consumption doesn't exceed a certain bound.
//! Since receiving a request and a response is a one-time process that occupies an entire
//! substream, allocations referenced by points 2- and 4- are also bounded thanks to this limit.
//! Request-response protocols enforce a limit to the size of the request and response, again
//! guaranteeing a bound on the memory consumption.
//!
//! In order to solve 3-, always use [`SingleStream::notification_substream_queued_bytes`] in order
//! to check the current amount of buffered data before calling
//! [`SingleStream::write_notification_unbounded`]. See the documentation of
//! [`SingleStream::write_notification_unbounded`] for more details.
//!
//! In order to solve 5-, // TODO: .
