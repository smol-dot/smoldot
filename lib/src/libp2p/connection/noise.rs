//! Noise protocol libp2p layer.
//!
//! The [noise protocol](https://noiseprotocol.org/) is a standard framework for building
//! cryptographic protocols. Libp2p uses the noise protocol to provide an encryption layer on
//! top of which data is exchanged.
//!
//! # Protocol details
//!
//! Libp2p uses [the XX pattern](https://noiseexplorer.com/patterns/XX/). The handshake consists
//! of three packets:
//!
//! - The initiator generates an ephemeral key pair and sends the public key to the responder.
//! - The responder generates its own ephemeral key pair and sends the public key to the
//! initiator. Afterwards, the responder derives a shared secret and uses it to encrypt all
//! further communications. Now encrypted, the responder also sends back its static noise public
//! key (represented with the [`NoiseKey`] type of this module), its libp2p public key, and a
//! signature of the static noise public key made using its libp2p private key.
//! - The initiator, after having received the ephemeral key from the remote, derives the same
//! shared secret. It sends its own static noise public key, libp2p public key, and signature.
//!
//! After these three packets, the initiator and responder derive another shared secret using
//! both the static and ephemeral keys, which is then used to encrypt communications. Note that
//! the libp2p key isn't used in the key derivation.
//!
//! # Usage
//!
//! While this is out of scope of this module, the noise protocol must typically first be
//! negotiated using the *multistream-select* protocol. The name of the protocol is given by
//! the [`PROTOCOL_NAME`] constant.
//!
//! In order to use noise on top of a connection which has agreed to use noise, create a
//! [`HandshakeInProgress`], passing a [`NoiseKey`]. This [`NoiseKey`] is typically generated at
//! startup and doesn't need to be persisted after a restart.
//!
//! Use [`HandshakeInProgress::read_write`] when data is received from the wire or when the remote
//! is ready to receive more data. At every call, a [`NoiseHandshake`] is returned, potentially
//! indicating the end of the handshake.
//!
//! If the handshake is finished, a [`NoiseHandshake::Success`] is returned, containing the
//! [`PeerId`] of the remote, which is known to be legitimate, and a [`Noise`] object through
//! which all further communications should go through.
//!

// # Q&A
//
// ## Why not use a library such as `snow`?
//
// Snow suffers from a variety of problems:
//
// - It doesn't support `no_std`.
// - It uses outdated versions of dependencies.
// - It doesn't allow writing a single Noise message onto two consecutive buffers.
// - It doesn't support encoding a Noise message already present in the output buffer.
// - It isn't really maintained.
// - It doesn't give control over its random number generator.
//

/// From the point of view of the noise protocol specification, this [`NoiseKey`] corresponds to
/// the static key. The noise key is typically generated at startup and doesn't have to be
/// persisted on disk, contrary to the libp2p key which is typically persisted after a restart.

/// - The easier way, by passing the libp2p private key to [`NoiseKey::new`].
/// - The slightly more complex way, by first creating an [`UnsignedNoiseKey`], then passing a
