//! Finalized block header, plus tree of authenticated non-finalized block headers.
//!
//! This module provides the [`NonFinalizedTree`] type. This type is a data structure
//! containing a valid tree of block headers, plus the state necessary to verify new blocks with
//! the intent to add them to that tree. Each block header additionally holds a user-chosen
//! opaque data.
//!
//! The state in the [`NonFinalizedTree`] consists of:
//!
//! - One "latest finalized" block and various information about its ancestors, akin to a
//!   [`chain_information::ChainInformation`].
//! - Zero or more blocks that descend from that latest finalized block.
//!
//! The latest finalized block is a block that is guaranteed to never be reverted. While it can
//! always be set to the genesis block of the chain, it is preferable, in order to reduce
//! memory utilization, to maintain it to a block that is as high as possible in the chain.
//!
//! > **Note**: While mechanisms such as GrandPa provide a network-wide way to designate a block
//! >           as final, the concept of GrandPa-provided finality doesn't necessarily have to
//! >           match the concept of finality in the [`NonFinalizedTree`]. For example, an API
//! >           user might decide to optimistically assume that the block whose number is
//! >           `highest_block - 5` is automatically finalized, and fall back to rebuilding a new
//! >           [`NonFinalizedTree`] if that assumption turns out to not be true. The finalized
//! >           block in the [`NonFinalizedTree`] only represents a block that the
//! >           [`NonFinalizedTree`] itself cannot remove, not a block that cannot be removed in
//! >           the absolute.
//!
//! A block can be added to the chain by calling [`NonFinalizedTree::verify_header`] then
//! [`NonFinalizedTree::insert_verified_header`]. As explained in details in
//! [the `verify` module](crate::verify), verifying the header only verifies the authenticity of
//! a block and not its correctness. Additionally verifying the body of the block provides the
//! strongest guarantee, but is the responsibility of the API user and is out of the scope of
//! this module.
//!
//! > **Note**: There typically exists two kinds of clients: full and light. Full clients store
//! >           the state of the storage, while light clients don't. For this reason, light
//! >           clients can only verify the header of new blocks. Both full and light clients
//! >           should wait for a block to be finalized if they want to be certain that it will
//! >           forever remain part of the chain.
//!
//! Additionally, a [`NonFinalizedTree::verify_justification`] method is provided in order to
//! verify the correctness of a [justification](crate::finality).
