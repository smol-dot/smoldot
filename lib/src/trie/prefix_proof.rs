//! Scanning, through trie proofs, the list of all keys that share a certain prefix.
//!
//! This module is a helper whose objective is to find out the list of all keys that start with
//! a certain prefix by performing storage proofs.
//!
//! The total number of storage proofs required is equal to the maximum depth of the tree below
//! the requested prefix, plus one. For example, if a tree has the nodes `[1, 5]`, `[1, 5, 8, 9]`,
//! and `[1, 5, 8, 9, 2]`, then four queries are necessary to find all the keys whose prefix
//! is `[1]`.
