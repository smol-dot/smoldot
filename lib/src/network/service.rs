//! State machine of all networking connections.
//!
//! The [`ChainNetwork`] struct is a state machine containing multiple collections that are
//! controlled by the API user:
//!
//! - A list of networking connections, identified by a [`ConnectionId`]. Each connection is
//! either in the handshake phase, healthy, or shutting down. Each connection in the handshake
//! phase has an optional expected [`PeerId`] representing the identity of the node that is
//! expected to be reached once the handshake is finished. Each connection that is healthy or
//! shutting down has an (actual) [`PeerId`] associated to it.
//! - A list of chains, identified by a [`ChainId`].
//! - A set of "desired" `(ChainId, PeerId, GossipKind)` tuples representing, for each chain, the
//! identities of the nodes that the API user wants to establish a gossip link with.
//!
//! In addition to this, the [`ChainNetwork`] also exposes:
//!
//! - A set of `(ChainId, PeerId, GossipKind)` tuples representing the gossip links that have been
//! established.
//! - A list of outgoing requests, identified by a [`SubstreamId`], that have been sent to a peer
//! and that are awaiting a response.
//! - A list of ingoing requests, identified by a [`SubstreamId`], that have been received from a
//! peer and that must be answered by the API user.
//! - A list of outgoing gossip link connection attempts, identified by a [`SubstreamId`], that
//! must be answered by the peer.
//! - A set of `(ChainId, PeerId, GossipKind)` tuples representing the peers that would like to
//! establish a gossip link with the local node, and that are awaiting a response by the API user.
//!
//! # Usage
//!
//! At initialization, create a new [`ChainNetwork`] with [`ChainNetwork::new`], and add chains
//! using [`ChainNetwork::add_chain`].
//!
//! The [`ChainNetwork`] doesn't automatically open connections to peers. This must be done
//! manually using [`ChainNetwork::add_single_stream_connection`] or
//! [`ChainNetwork::add_multi_stream_connection`]. Choosing which peer to connect to and through
//! which address is outside of the scope of this module.
//!
//! Adding a connection using [`ChainNetwork::add_single_stream_connection`] or
//! [`ChainNetwork::add_multi_stream_connection`] returns a "connection task". This connection task
//! must be processed. TODO: expand explanation here
//!
//! After a message has been injected using [`ChainNetwork::inject_connection_message`], repeatedly
//! [`ChainNetwork::next_event`] until it returns `None` in order to determine what has happened.
//!
//! Once a connection has been established (which is indicated by a [`Event::HandshakeFinished`]
//! event), one can open a gossip link to this peer using [`ChainNetwork::gossip_open`].
//!
//! In order to faciliate this process, the [`ChainNetwork`] provides a "desired gossip links"
//! system. Use [`ChainNetwork::gossip_insert_desired`] and [`ChainNetwork::gossip_remove_desired`]
//! to insert or remove `(ChainId, PeerId, GossipKind)` tuples into the state machine. You can
//! then use [`ChainNetwork::unconnected_desired`] to obtain a list of [`PeerId`]s that are marked
//! as desired and for which a connection should be opened, and
//! [`ChainNetwork::connected_unopened_gossip_desired`] to obtain a list of [`PeerId`]s that are
//! marked as desired and that have a healthy connection and for which a gossip link should be
//! opened. Marking peers as desired only influences the return values of
//! [`ChainNetwork::unconnected_desired`] and [`ChainNetwork::connected_unopened_gossip_desired`]
//! and has no other effect.
//!

// TODO: expand explanations once the API is finalized
