//! Basic address book and slots assignments algorithm.
//!
//! The [`BasicPeeringStrategy`] contains a collection of network identities, identified by
//! a [`PeerId`]. Each network identity is associated to one or more chains, identified by a
//! `TChainId`.
//!
//! Each network-identity-chain association can be in one of these three states:
//!
//! - Normal.
//! - Banned until a certain instant represented by `TInstant`.
//! - Has a slot.
//!
//! "Normal" and "banned" network-identity-chain associations represent the potential peers to
//! connect to, while "slot" represent pending or established gossip slots.
//!
//! Use [`BasicPeeringStrategy::pick_assignable_peer`] in order to assign a slot to a
//! randomly-chosen network-identity that doesn't currently have one.
//!
//! If a gossip slot fails to be established with a certain peer, or if the peer misbehaves,
//! use [`BasicPeeringStrategy::unassign_slot_and_ban`] to ban the peer, preventing it from
//! obtaining a slot for a certain amount of time.
//!
//! Each network identity that is associated with at least one chain is associated with zero or
//! more addresses. It is not possible to insert addresses to peers that aren't associated to at
//! least one chain. The number of active connections of each address is also tracked.
//!
//! There exists a limit to the number of peers per chain and the number of addresses per peer,
//! guaranteeing that the data structure only uses a bounded amount of memory. If these limits
//! are reached, peers and addresses are removed randomly. Peers that have a slot and at least one
//! connected address are never removed.
