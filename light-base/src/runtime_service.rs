//! Background runtime download service.
//!
//! This service plugs on top of a [`sync_service`], listens for new best blocks and checks
//! whether the runtime has changed in any way. Its objective is to always provide an up-to-date
//! [`executor::host::HostVmPrototype`] ready to be called by other services.
//!
//! # Usage
//!
//! The runtime service lets user subscribe to block updates, similar to the [`sync_service`].
//! These subscriptions are implemented by subscribing to the underlying [`sync_service`] and,
//! for each notification, checking whether the runtime has changed (thanks to the presence or
//! absence of a header digest item), and downloading the runtime code if necessary. Therefore,
//! these notifications might come with a delay compared to directly using the [`sync_service`].
//!
//! If it isn't possible to download the runtime code of a block (for example because peers refuse
//! to answer or have already pruned the block) or if the runtime service already has too many
//! pending downloads, this block is simply not reported on the subscriptions. The download will
//! be repeatedly tried until it succeeds.
//!
//! Consequently, you are strongly encouraged to not use both the [`sync_service`] *and* the
//! [`RuntimeService`] of the same chain. They each provide a consistent view of the chain, but
//! this view isn't necessarily the same on both services.
//!
//! The main service offered by the runtime service is [`RuntimeService::subscribe_all`], that
//! notifies about new blocks once their runtime is known.
//!
//! # Blocks pinning
//!
//! Blocks that are reported through [`RuntimeService::subscribe_all`] are automatically *pinned*.
//! If multiple subscriptions exist, each block is pinned once per subscription.
//!
//! As long as a block is pinned, the [`RuntimeService`] is guaranteed to keep in its internal
//! state the runtime of this block and its properties.
//!
//! Blocks must be manually unpinned by calling [`Subscription::unpin_block`].
//! Failing to do so is effectively a memory leak. If the number of pinned blocks becomes too
//! large, the subscription is force-killed by the [`RuntimeService`].
//!
