//! Background JSON-RPC service.
//!
//! # Usage
//!
//! Create a new JSON-RPC service by calling [`service()`].
//! Creating a JSON-RPC service spawns a background task (through [`PlatformRef::spawn_task`])
//! dedicated to processing JSON-RPC requests.
//!
//! In order to process a JSON-RPC request, call [`Frontend::queue_rpc_request`]. Later, the
//! JSON-RPC service can queue a response or, in the case of subscriptions, a notification. They
//! can be retrieved by calling [`Frontend::next_json_rpc_response`].
//!
//! In the situation where an attacker finds a JSON-RPC request that takes a long time to be
//! processed and continuously submits this same expensive request over and over again, the queue
//! of pending requests will start growing and use more and more memory. For this reason, if this
//! queue grows past [`Config::max_pending_requests`] items, [`Frontend::queue_rpc_request`]
//! will instead return an error.
//!

// TODO: re-review this once finished
