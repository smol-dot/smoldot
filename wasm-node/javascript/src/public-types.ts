     * # Explanation and usage
     *
     * The primary way smoldot determines which relay chain is associated to a parachain is by
     * inspecting the chain specification of that parachain (i.e. the `chainSpec` field).
     *
     * This poses a problem in situations where the same client is shared between multiple different
     * applications: multiple applications could add mutiple different chains with the same `id`,
     * creating an ambiguity, or an application could register malicious chains with small variations
     * of a popular chain's `id` and try to benefit from a typo in a legitimate application's
     * `relayChain`.
     *
     * These problems can be solved by using this parameter to segregate multiple different uses of
     * the same client. To use it, pass the list of all chains that the same application has
     * previously added to the client. By doing so, you are guaranteed that the chains of multiple
     * different applications can't interact in any way (good or bad), while still benefiting from
     * the de-duplication of resources that smoldot performs in `addChain`.
     *
     * When multiple different parachains use the same relay chain, it is important to be sure that
     * they are indeed using the same relay chain, and not accidentally using different ones. For
     * this reason, this parameter is a list of potential relay chains in which only one chain
     * should match, rather than a single `Chain` corresponding to the relay chain.
