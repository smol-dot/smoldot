//! Imports and exports of the WebAssembly module.
//!
//! This module contains all the functions that tie together the Rust code and its host (i.e.
//! the JavaScript code, normally).
//!
//! The functions found in the `extern` block are the functions that the Rust code *imports*, and
//! need to be implemented on the host side and provided to the WebAssembly virtual machine. The
//! other functions are functions that the Rust code *exports*, and can be called by the host.
//!
//! # Re-entrency
//!
//! As a rule, none of the implementations of the functions that the host provides is allowed
//! to call a function exported by Rust.
//!
//! For example, the implementation of [`start_timer`] isn't allowed to call [`timer_finished`].
//! Instead, it must return, and later [`timer_finished`] be called independently.
//!
//! This avoids potential stack overflows and tricky borrowing-related situations.
//!
//! # About `u32`s and JavaScript
//!
//! Many functions below accept as parameter or return a `u32`. In reality, however, the
//! WebAssembly specification doesn't mention unsigned integers. Only signed integers (and
//! floating points) can be passed through the FFI layer.
//!
//! This isn't important when the Rust code provides a value that must later be provided back, as
//! the conversion from the guest to the host is symmetrical to the conversion from the host to
//! the guest.
//!
//! It is, however, important when the value needs to be interpreted from the host side, such as
//! for example the `message_ptr` parameter of [`panic()`]. When using JavaScript as the host, you
//! must do `>>> 0` on all the `u32` values before interpreting them, in order to be certain than
//! they are treated as unsigned integers by the JavaScript.
//!

    /// # About throwing and safety
    ///
    /// Rust programs can be configured in two panicking modes: `abort`, or `unwind`. Safe or
    /// unsafe Rust code must be written by keeping in mind that the execution of a function can
    /// be suddenly interrupted by a panic, but can rely on the fact that this panic will either
    /// completely abort the program, or unwind the stack. In the latter case, they can rely on
    /// the fact that `std::panic::catch_unwind` will catch this unwinding and let them perform
    /// some additional clean-ups.
    ///
    /// This function is typically implemented using `throw`. However, "just" throwing a JavaScript
    /// exception from within the implementation of this function is neither `abort`, because the
    /// JavaScript could call into the Wasm again later, nor `unwind`, because it isn't caught by
    /// `std::panic::catch_unwind`. By being neither of the two, it breaks the assumptions that
    /// some Rust codes might rely on for either correctness or safety.
    /// In order to solve this problem, we enforce that `panic` must behave like `abort`, and
    /// forbid calling into the Wasm virtual machine again.
